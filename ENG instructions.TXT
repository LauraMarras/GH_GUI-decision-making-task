1 Task Instructions:
1
1During this task, you will be shown a series of images. The images are 30 in total, and each one will be presented 
14 times, so there will be 120 presentations in total, in random order.
1
1We assigned half of the images to be “winning” and the other half to be “losing”. Every time one image is presented, 
1your goal is to guess and indicate whether it is of the "winning" or "losing" category. 
1As soon as the image disappears, you will have up to 2 seconds to make your choice:
1    - Press the left arrow to choose Winning
1    - Press the right arrow to choose Losing
2If you respond before the image disappears, the answer will not be valid, so make sure to wait until the image 
2disappears to give your response.
2
2If you take longer than 2 secs to respond, the answer will not be valid and you will se a warning asking you to 
2speed up, so try to answer as fast as possible.
3Of course, when an image is presented for the first time, you won't know the correct answer, so you will have to guess. 
3But, after your choice, you will receive feedback consisting of:
3    - A letter, indicating what was the correct category: W (winning) or L (losing)
3    - A colour and a sound, which indicate whether your choice was accurate or not (coins or buzz sound, yellow or blue)
3So, by paying attention to the feedback, you can learn which is the right category for each image and when the image is 
3presented again, you can try to answer correctly. 
3
3The goal is to learn the correct categories and make less errors as possible.
3Be ready, right after the feedback a new image will be presented.
